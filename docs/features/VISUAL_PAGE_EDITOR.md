## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/content` - Create new page content
- `PUT /api/content` - Update existing page content
- `DELETE /api/content?id={id}` - Delete page content

### Image Processing

## Database Schema

### Content Collection
```typescript
interface Content {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  tenant: string;
  content: ComponentProps[];
  description?: string;
  isPublished: boolean;
  publishedAt?: Date;
  meta?: {
    keywords?: string;
    description?: string;
  };
}
```

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  id: string;
  type: 'text' | 'image' | 'button' | 'bookingChatbot' | 'barberProfile' | 'testimonial';
  content?: string;
  src?: string;
  alt?: string;
  url?: string;
  srcSet?: string;
  sizes?: string;
}
```

## Best Practices

### For Content Creators
1. **Start with a Plan**: Sketch out your page layout before building
2. **Use High-Quality Images**: Upload images at least 1200px wide for best results
3. **Write Descriptive Alt Text**: Help visually impaired users understand your images
4. **Test on Mobile**: Preview your pages on different screen sizes
5. **Keep it Simple**: Don't overload pages with too many components

### For Administrators
1. **Configure Settings**: Set up which components and effects are available
2. **Monitor Usage**: Check which pages are most popular
3. **Backup Content**: Regularly export important page content
4. **Train Users**: Provide guidance on best practices for content creation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Image Editor Not Opening**
- Check that `settings.editor.imageEditor.enabled` is `true`
- Verify the image file is under the maximum size limit
- Ensure the file type is supported (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

**Page Builder Not Loading**
- Verify `settings.editor.pageBuilder.enabled` is `true`
- Check that the user has admin or barber permissions
- Ensure all required components are properly configured

**Images Not Optimizing**
- Check the `/api/image-optimize` endpoint is working
- Verify Bunny CDN credentials are configured
- Ensure the media collection is properly set up

**Components Not Saving**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify the `/api/content` endpoint is accessible
- Ensure the user has proper permissions

### Performance Tips
1. **Optimize Images**: Use the image editor to crop and compress images before adding them
2. **Limit Components**: Don't add too many components to a single page
3. **Use Caching**: Enable browser caching for better performance
4. **Monitor File Sizes**: Keep individual images under 5MB

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only admins and barbers can access the page builder
- Content is tenant-specific and isolated
- Image uploads are validated for type and size

### Data Protection
- All content is stored securely in the database
- Images are processed server-side
- No sensitive data is exposed in the frontend

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are sanitized
- File uploads are validated for type and size
- SQL injection is prevented through parameterized queries

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Advanced Image Effects**: Filters, overlays, and text on images
- **Component Templates**: Pre-built layouts for common page types
- **Version History**: Track changes and revert to previous versions
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users editing the same page
- **Analytics**: Track page performance and user engagement

### Integration Opportunities
- **E-commerce**: Product catalogs and shopping carts
- **Social Media**: Direct sharing to social platforms
- **Email Marketing**: Newsletter signup forms
- **Customer Reviews**: Integration with review platforms
